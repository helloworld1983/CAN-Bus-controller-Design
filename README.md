# CAN-Bus-controller-Design
CAN Bus controller was designed for standard data frame and remote data frame. Bit stuffing was implemented to ensure that for every 5 consecutive same bits an inverted bit was inserted in the frame. Cyclic Redundancy Code(CRC) was implemented for error handling. Bit timing state machine was implemented to achieve greater synchronization at the receiver. AHB protocol (slave/master) was implemented to receive and transmit the data bit at a time on the bus. Further 8 AHB-CAN Transmitter were instantiated and operated over the bus. These devices used a round robin arbitrator to get the data on bus towards test bench(or other devices).
